1. Name
Kyohei Mizutani

2. How long it took to complete
1 hour

3. One thing I liked
Falling 100 cubes from the sky is very impressive when I see this with Google CardBoard.

4. One thing that was challenging about this project
At first I changed the variable "numCubes" directly in the script to 100 from 10 but actual number of cubes were not changed since I should change variable from inspecter for public variables.
